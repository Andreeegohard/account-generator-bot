# account-generator-bot
Simple discord python bot for account generating system.

## Step 1: Setting Up Configuration File

1. Navigate to your bot project directory on your local machine where you have cloned the GitHub repository.

2. Create a file named `config.json` in your project directory if it doesn't already exist.

3. Open `config.json` in a text editor and add the following structure:

   ```json
   {
       "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
       "webhook": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
   }
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` with your bot token obtained from the platform you're using (e.g., Discord, Telegram), and `"YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"` with the URL of your webhook if applicable.

4. Save and close the `config.json` file.

## Step 2: Running the Bot

1. Open your command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

2. Navigate to your bot project directory using the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/bot/project
   ```

3. Run your bot script using Python with the following command:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

   Replace `bot.py` with the name of your bot script if it's different.

4. Your bot should now be running and interacting with the respective platform based on your bot's implementation.

## Additional Tips:

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your command-line interface. If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Ensure that all necessary dependencies for your bot are installed. You can typically install dependencies using `pip`, Python's package manager. If your project has a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies, you can install them using:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Make sure your bot token and webhook URL (if applicable) are kept confidential. Avoid sharing them publicly or committing them to version control systems like Git.

- Periodically update your `config.json` file with new tokens or webhook URLs if they change.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up your Python bot to run locally on your machine using the configuration file, and interact with it via the command line.
